# CSGOEmpireRaceCondition
PATCHED - 13/04/2023. A Race Condition Vulnerability found on the Website CSGOEmpire. This would allow you to bet against yourself on a roulette game and to gain unlimited EXP. A python script was developed to expolit the vulnerability easily.

*Since the update to the website this is now a feature and no longer a vulnerability.*


During my engagement with CSGOempires, I discovered a race condition vulnerability while participating in a game of roulette on their main website. By exploiting this flaw, I was able to place simultaneous bets on both the Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist options, resulting in a nominal wager of 0.01 tokens. As a result of the race condition, I consistently broke even each time the winner was determined, enabling me to gain an unlimited amount of experience without incurring significant monetary losses. The only time a loss occurred was when a "Dice" was rolled, however, the loss was only 0.02 which is insignificant to most members. (During testing, any number of tokens can be used to gain EXP faster).
